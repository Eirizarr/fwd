<h3 id="project-four">User-Tested Portal Revision <small>Due May 4, 11:59pm CT</small></h3>
      <p>
        The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s Web Portal Redesign project
        to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to make recommendations for the agile, incremental
        improvements to the Web Portal Redesign project based on what you learn through your user
        tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
        welcome to use as a starting point and/or modify his sample script and recording release
        form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s website</a>.
        However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and tasks (obviously).
      </p>
      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul class="goals">
        <li>
          Evaluate user interface designs with human subjects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrate how user-centered concerns can be incorporated into system development life
          cycles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain the need to evaluate system usability.

      <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike previous projects, your deliverables for this assignment should be handed in to the
        instructor as a Dropbox or Google Drive share URL (do <b>not</b> use the internal sharing
        function on Dropbox or Drive with the instructor). The URL should point to a folder

     <h3 id="project-two">Project Two: Media-Rich Single-Page Site <small>Due March 21, 11:59pm CT</small></h3>
      <p>
        Single-page sites have seen a resurgent interest in recent years, particularly for
        showcasing products, services, or an entire company. See <a
        href="https://onepagelove.com/">One Page Love</a> for a gallery of examples. This project
        requires you to engage in well-crafted, mobile-first responsive web design with careful,
        bandwidth-friendly treatment of rich media elements as well as responsive images for
        traditional and high-DPI/“retina” screens. You will use the site to tell the story of a
        particular company, product, or organization, and implement elements of your onboarding
        project (Project One). Alternatively, you may use this project to build a one-page site for
        that tells your own professional story, perhaps a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages">GitHub user page</a>
        at &lt;username&gt;.github.io.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging in storytelling, you should think both about how the text content of a site
        tells a story, but also how image, audio, and video also helps to tell a story. As we will
        see in the remaining projects in class, good HCI is also good story-telling. It’s a story
        that users/readers can insert themselves into. This project invites you to get even stronger
        in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, while also thinking about techniques and
        strategies to get a specific group of people to want to read all the way through a page.
      </p>
      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Design and execute a progressively enhanced page focused on system users and tasks</li>
        <li>Write valid HTML5 and CSS, and error-free JavaScript</li>
        <li>Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design</li>
        <li>Use Modernizr or another lightweight feature-detection script for implementing edge CSS technologies (with appropriate fallbacks for lesser browsers)</li>
        <li>Write compelling text content; capture images, audio, and video and prepare them for the web</li>
        <li>Prepare a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design</li>
        <li>
          Engage in agile, iterative Web design and development, supported by version control
        </li>
        <li>Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>

        <li>

      <h3 id="project-one">Project One: Onboarding <small>Due February 19, 11:59pm CT</small></h3>
      <p>
        This project requires you to create a compelling page design and sign-up process to get new
        users to join some type of project: an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source
        community. Project emphasis will be on effortless, engaging entry of personal information;
        and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or
        incomplete information. The goal of this project is to hit on particular patterns of
        interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering—not at all
        an easy task.

      <h3 id="project-three">Project Three: Web Portal Redesign <small>Due April 18, 11:59pm CT</small></h3>
      <p>
        Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking/credit card
        payment, web portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
        workers. For this project, self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the login page,
        the welcome page/tab, and all necessary pages for achieving a specific student-user task
        (some examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class, paying a tuition bill,
        removing a registration hold, or any other task that you achive through MyIIT as a student).
        Your redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of
        human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.
      </p>
      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul class="goals">

        <li>Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design</li>
        <li>Prepare a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design</li>
