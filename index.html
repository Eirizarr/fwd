          <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Because technology is an essential part of contemporary editing as well as online
            learning, proficiency and skill with technology is essential to your success in this
            class. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for
            class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
            it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
            provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
            meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you
            contact me via email or GChat well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of that being said, I am committed to providing the most accessible online course I
            possibly can. I have gone to great lengths to make the course website accessible on
            mobile and desktop devices, for screen readers, etc. I have also chosen services for
            video, collaboration, and so on that I believe to be mobile friendly. <b>If you should
            find that any aspect of the course is not working on your phone/tablet/computer, please
            contact me immediately via email.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that
            GitHub accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy
            you are certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b>
            At the same time, you might want to think about how establishing GitHub and other
            accounts under your own name, in cases where you conduct yourself professionally, might
            actually be an asset to your online presence, and the results that future schools or
            employers turn up when they search for you on Google and elsewhere.
          </p>

          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
            as described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
            work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
            design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
            open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
            legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
            Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
            order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
            Center for Disability Resources. The <a href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for
            Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the
            first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135,
            or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
            ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
            at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
            or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
            students.
